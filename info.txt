A 1v1 card game where players take on the role of rival robot engineers, building and programming robots to compete in a series of battles.
Each turn, players draw from a deck of cards representing different robot parts, such as motors, weapons, and sensors.
Players use these cards to build and upgrade their robots, and then program them to battle against their opponent's robots.
Points are scored for winning battles and for successfully completing special programming challenges.
The game ends when one player reaches a certain number of points or runs out of cards in their deck.
